What [a wonderful little story][1] I've found over at [Spreading Goodwill][2]:

> THE MAYONNAISE JAR AND 2 CUPS OF COFFEE

>

> When things in your life seem almost too much to handle, when 24 hours in a
day are not enough, remember the mayonnaise jar and the 2 cups of coffee…

>

> A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of
him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very large and empty
mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the
students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was.

>

> The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar.
He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the
golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed
it was.

>

> The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of
course, the sand filled up everything else. He asked once more if the jar was
full.

>

> The students responded with a unanimous yes." The professor then produced
two cups of coffee from under the table and poured the entire contents into
the jar, effectively filling the empty space between the sand.

>

> The students laughed.

>

> "Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided, "I want you to
recognize that this jar represents your life.

>

> The golf balls are the important things -- your family, your children, your
health, your friends, and your favorite passions -- things that if everything
else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full.

>

> The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, and
your car. The sand is everything else -- the small stuff."

>

> "If you put the sand into the jar first," he continued, "there is no room
for the pebbles or the golf balls."

>

> The same goes for life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small
stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you.

>

> Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with
your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your partner out to
dinner. Play another 18. There will always be time to clean the house and fix
the disposal later.

>

> Take care of the golf balls first -- the things that really matter. Set your
priorities. The rest is just sand."

>

> One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee
represented. The professor smiled.

>

> "I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your
life may seem, there's always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a
friend."
